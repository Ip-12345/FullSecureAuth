# üîí ZAP Security Scan Report ‚Äì IpVault App

This document summarizes the results of an automated security assessment performed using **OWASP ZAP (v2.16.1)** for the **Authify application**, a full-stack web app using:

- üîπ React (Frontend) ‚Äì `localhost:5173`
- üîπ Spring Boot (Backend) ‚Äì `localhost:8080`

| Risk Level     | Number of Alerts |
|----------------|------------------|
| üî¥ High         | 0                |
| üü† Medium       | 0                |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert Details

| Type               | Risk Level    | Confidence | Endpoint Tested            |
|--------------------|---------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| `User Agent Fuzzer` | Informational | Medium     | `GET /api/v1.0` on backend  |

> This alert was generated by ZAP trying various `User-Agent` headers to probe responses. No unusual behavior was detected. This is **not a security issue**, just a generic observation from a fuzzer module.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- No known vulnerabilities were detected in the exposed endpoints of the Authify backend.
- The app appears to correctly handle authenticated and unauthenticated requests.
- This scan confirms basic security hygiene for the API layer.

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations

| Area                | Suggestion                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication      | Consider automating login with Context Auth   |
| Headers             | Add Security Headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)        |
| Scan Depth          | Enable passive scanner add-ons for deeper checks |
| Testing Scope       | Add more complex test cases with input fuzzing |

For any future enhancements, include CI-based security testing and SAST tools alongside ZAP.
